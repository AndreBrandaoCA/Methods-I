Part I ‒ Methods with an empty parameter list and do not return a value: [Questions 1-8 required]
	Write a method called DisplayPersonalInfo(). This method will display your name, school, program and your favorite course. Call the DisplayPersonalInfo() method from your program Main() method
	Write a method called CalculateTuition(). This method will prompt the user for the number of courses that she is currently taking and then calculate and display the tuition cost. (cost = number of course * 569.99). Call the CalculateTuition() method two times from the same Main() method as in question 1.
	Write a method call CalculateAreaOfCircle(). This method will prompt the user for the radius of a circle and then calculate and display the area.[A = πr2]. 
Call the CalculateAreaOfCircle() method twice from the same Main() method as in question 1. Use Math.Pi for the value of π
	Write a method call CalculateAreaOfTriangle(), that prompts the user for the base and height of a triangle and then calculate and display the area.[ A=bt/2 ] 
Call the CalculateAreaOfTriangle() method twice from the same Main() method as in question 1.
	Write a method call CalculateSaleCommission(), that prompts the user for his sales figure, and then calculate and display his commission. (commission = 25% of sales in excess of 1000. If sales is equal to or below $1000.00 there is no commission) 
Call the CalculateSaleCommission() method three times from the same Main() method as in question 1.
	Write a method call DisplaySineTable(), that prompts the user for a starting value and an step size. The method will calculate and display a table (10 rows) of sine values based on the user input. Use the built-in method Math.Sin() to obtain the sine of an angle. e.g. if the starting value is 0.5 and the step size is 0.03 the method will display the following table:
0.50	0.4794
0.53	0.5055
0.56	0.5311

0.77	0.6961
The numbers in both columns MUST be right aligned. Call the DisplaySineTable() method from the same Main() method as in question 1.
	In a write a method called DisplayMenu() to display the following text on screen:

          Enter the number of your choice ->
You may replace the instructor’s name with your name.
	Add another method called ShowMenu() to your project. This method will call the method in question 7 continuously until the user presses 0. (You will have to invoke the method in a loop body, read in the user input as well as check the input). You will need to hook up all the methods that you wrote previously i.e. questions 1 to 6. Replace all the code from your Main() method with a single call to the ShowMenu() method.
